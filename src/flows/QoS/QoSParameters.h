/*
 * Bearer Level QoS (TS 23.401, Clause 4.7.3)
 *
 * A bearer uniquely identifies traffic flows that receive a
 * common QoS treatment.
 *
 * Each bearer (GBR and Non-GBR) is associated with
 * the following bearer level QoS parameters:
 *
 *  ** QoS Class Identifier (QCI)
 *  A QCI is a scalar that is used as a reference to access node-specific
 *  parameters that control bearer level packet forwarding treatment
 *  (e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management
 *  thresholds, link layer protocol configuration, etc.), and that have been
 *  pre-configured by the operator owning the access node (e.g. eNodeB).
 *  A one-to-one mapping of standardized QCI values to standardized
 *  characteristics is captured TS 23.203 [6].
 *
 *  ** Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP),
 *  The ARP shall contain information about the priority
 *  level (scalar), the pre-emption capability (flag) and the
 *  pre-emption vulnerability (flag).
 *
 *  ** Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) for UP and DW link
 *  ** Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) for UP and DW link
 *  The GBR denotes the bit rate that can be expected to
 *  be provided by a GBR bearer. The MBR limits the bit rate that
 *  can be expected to be provided by a GBR bearer
 *  (e.g. excess traffic may get discarded by a rate shaping function).
 *  See clause 4.7.4 for further details on GBR and MBR
